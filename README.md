transac-redline
===============

transac-redline is a centralized  logging system aimed at helping monitoring business applications.

It's a very pragmatic and simple system made of a restful HTTP server based on node.js and mongodb, a HTML single page application written with angularjs and clients (node.js, ruby, python, perl, ...).

The node version is quite new, but the a previous version in ruby was in use for many years in very constraints production environments.

If you have to monitor results of many processes / batches (made in different languages) and you want to identify quickly their states, and in case of failure see why they failed, this tool is for you.

It's neither Nagios nor syslog, it's more business oriented, rather than system, it's a complementary tool for applications support teams.
 

### Usage

Install a mongo database, setup To be continued ....

```javascript 
npm install transac-redline

```

### Concepts

A `transac` of course, is not a transaction, it's a set of messages associated with a name and a date.

A `transac` is uniquely defined by:
  * `name`: Name of the transac 
  * `valueDate`: default to today, but can reference usually a past date. Useful when the processing date of a process is different from the reference date of elements processed.

A `transac` can be locked: it means system will refuse to execute a new transac with same couple (`name`, `valueDate`).

A `transac` is made of events: ('time', 'type', 'label', 'message'). `type` belongs to ['info', 'warning', 'error'].

A client can start, commit and abort a `transac`. All those actions only change `transac`'s state which can be within ['ok', 'warning', 'error'].

A `transac` can imbricate other transacs on one level: a script is launched many times a day, to avoid to pollute our journal with the same transac's name, we can define just one transac made of all the transacs generated by the script. To do that just start your transac with `nested` option at true.
